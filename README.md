# ArduinoReceiveSerialFromRPi
Example for receiving strings from Raspberry Pi on Arduino and processing them. Arduino expects '&lt;' to start string and '>' to end string. This example was used for control of rgb led strips. Modeled after some code I found in some forums, I can't remember the source.
